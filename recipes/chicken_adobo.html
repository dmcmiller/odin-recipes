    <h3>Description!</h3>
    <p>Filipino Chicken Adobo is the national dish of the Philippines and may well become your new favourite Asian chicken dish! Just a few everyday ingredients I can practically guarantee you already have, it’s an effortless recipe that yields juicy, tender chicken coated in a sweet savoury glaze with little pops of heat from peppercorns.

        This is a chicken thigh recipe and it MUST be made with thighs – no substituting with chicken breast!</p>

    <h3>Ingredients!</h3>    
    <ul>
        <li>boneless skinless chicken thighs – cannot substitute with breast, need the fat to transform sauce into a glaze;</li>
        <li>soy sauce – all purpose or light soy sauce. NOT dark soy sauce (bottle will be labelled as such if it’s dark soy sauce);

        </li>
        <li>white vinegar – just everyday, plain white vinegar. Sub with any clear vinegar, including rice wine, apple cider, sherry vinegar;

        </li>
        <li>onion and garlic</li>
        <li>peppercorns – or coarse cracked pepper</li>
        <li>sugar – brown best, white ok</li>
        <li>bay leaves – fresh or dried, not the end of the world if you don’t have; and

        </li>
        <li>green onion – optional garnish</li>

    </ul>

    <h3>Steps!</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>Combine Chicken and Marinade ingredients in a bowl. Marinate for at least 20 minutes, or up to overnight.
        </li>
        <li>Heat 1 tbsp oil in a skillet over high heat. Remove chicken from marinade (reserve marinade) and place in the pan. Sear both sides until browned – about 1 minute on each side. Do not cook the chicken all the way through</li>
        <li>Remove chicken skillet and set aside.</li>
        <li>Heat the remaining oil in skillet. Add garlic and onion, cook 1 1/2 minutes</li>
        <li>Add the reserved marinade, water, sugar and black pepper. Bring it to a simmer then turn heat down to medium high. Simmer 5 minutes.
        </li>
        <li>Add chicken smooth side down. Simmer uncovered for 20 to 25 minutes (no need to stir), turning chicken at around 15 minutes, until the sauce reduces down to a thick jam-like syrup.
        </li>
        <li>If the sauce isn't thick enough, remove chicken onto a plate and let the sauce simmer by itself - it will thicken much quicker - then return chicken to the skillet to coat in the glaze.
        </li>
        <li>Coat chicken in glaze then serve over rice. Pictured in post as a healthy dinner plate (415 calories) with cauliflower rice and Ginger Smashed Cucumbers.
