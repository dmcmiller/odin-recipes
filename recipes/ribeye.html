    <h3>Description!</h3>
    <p>This amazing cut of beef is definitely a favorite and in my opinion, one of the most flavorful out there. There is no need for special or fancy ingredients, just steaks, seasonings, a brush of oil, and a pat of butter for perfection.

    </p>

    <h3>Ingredients!</h3>    
    <ul>
        <li>2 ribeye steaks</li>
        <li>2 tablespoons olive oil</li>
        <li>steak seasoning</li>
        <li>2 tablespoons butter</li>

    </ul>

    <h3>Steps!</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>Remove steaks from the fridge at least 45 minutes before cooking.
        </li>
        <li>Just before cooking, rub steaks with olive oil and generously season to taste.
        </li>
        <li>Preheat grill to medium heat (approximately 375Â°F).
        </li>
        <li>Prepare steaks as above and grill 5-6 minutes per side for medium-rare or 6-7 minutes per side for medium.
        </li>
        <li>Remove from the grill and top with a pat of butter, loosely tent with foil. Rest steaks 5-10 minutes before serving.
        </li>
    </ol>
